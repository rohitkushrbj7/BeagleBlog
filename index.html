          <p>
            The Beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to
            the much larger foxhound. It was developed primarily for hunting hare
            (known as beagling). Possessing a great sense of smell and superior
            tracking instincts, the beagle is also used as a detection dog for
            prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs worldwide. As a popular
            pet, it's known for its good temper and lack of inherited health
            problems.
